**University ATM Simulation Project
Overview**
This ATM Simulation project is a key piece of my academic work at university, designed to demonstrate my understanding and application of object-oriented programming principles. It serves as a practical example of how theoretical concepts can be applied to build a functional and structured software system.

**Objectives**
The main goals of this project were to:

Develop a clear understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Apply OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Simulate real-world interactions within a banking system using Java.

Showcase the ability to design and implement a user-friendly console application.

**Features**
User Authentication: Validates account number and PIN.
Balance Inquiry: Allows users to check their account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Enables users to withdraw money.
Cash Deposit: Facilitates depositing money into the user's account.
Session Control: Ensures a secure and isolated session for each user interaction.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured into several classes, each representing a component of the ATM system:

Account: Manages account details.
ATM: Core class to initiate and control ATM operations.
BankDatabase: Simulates a backend database.
CashSlot, DepositSlot: Simulate physical components of an ATM.
KeyPad, Screen: Handle user input and output.
Transaction (and its subclasses Withdraw, Deposit, BalanceInquiry): Manage different types of banking transactions.
Entry: Entry point for running the simulation.

**Running the Simulation**
To run the simulation:

Clone the repository.
Compile the Java files using a Java IDE or command line.
Execute the Entry class to start the ATM application.

**Academic Value**
This project was an essential part of my coursework, allowing me to:

Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
Develop problem-solving and design skills in software development.
Gain hands-on experience in implementing a fully functional Java application.

**Future Employers**
For potential employers looking at this project:

This work showcases my foundational skills in Java and object-oriented design.
It reflects my ability to translate academic knowledge into practical solutions.
The code structure and comments offer insights into my coding style and approach to problem-solving.
